# Leetcode-challenges
  This project is mainly for solving leetcode challenges and discussing solutions. You could also create a pipeline and run it(optional).

# Prerequisites
  * Choose any language of your (C++, C, python, Rust)
  * Choose your favorite IDE for this
  * Create a unittest case to see if it also runs on the pipeline with a report
  * Create a Pull request and add your reviewers

# Problem description
  Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

# Example 1:
  * Input: s = "abcabcbb"
  * Output: 3
  * Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

# Example 2:
  * Input: s = "bbbbb"
  * Output: 1
  * Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
    
# Example 3:

  * Input: s = "pwwkew"
  * Output: 3
  * Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
  * Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

# Constraints:
  * 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
  * s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
